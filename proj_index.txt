 controllers: responsible for handling incoming requests from the client and sending responses back.
 Models:      represent the structure of the data. They are responsible for interacting with the database, 
              defining schemas, and handling data validation.
                -Define data structures (e.g., using ORMs like Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for SQL databases).
                -Perform database queries.
                -Validate and manipulate the data.

Services contain the business logic of your application. They handle tasks that are too complex for controllers,
such as calling multiple models, managing data transformations, or handling external API calls.
